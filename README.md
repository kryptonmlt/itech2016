Description

Rulers of the Kingdom is a medieval strategy war game. Users are able to gather resources and upgrade city structures. Updating their city allows them to better defend it against opponents as well as collect an increased number of resources from their structures such as gold mines. Users can also buy troops, limited by the number of farms. A good army allows users to win an attack other on users and steal their resources. In a battle both the attacker and defender will loose a certain amount of troops, depending on the outcome. The winner gains some gold. In order to upgrade city statructures and buy troops users are required to pay a certain amount of gold and/or specific resources like lumber and stones. Users can also create or join alliances with other users. Alliances give a sense of protection from enemies. To further emphasize the importance of alliances, we allow allies to chat between each other and give out orders in a group chat.
