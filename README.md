Description

Rulers of the Kingdom is a medieval strategy war game. Users are able to gather resources and upgrade city structures to collect an increased number of resources. Users can also buy troops, depending on the supply limit of farms, to create an army and attack other users to steal their resources. Either if an attacker wins or loses a battle he will lose a certain amount of tropps as well as the defender (depending on the battle outcome and a random factor). In order to upgrade city structures and buy troops users are required to pay a certain amount of gold and/or specific resources like lumber and stones. Users can also create and join alliances with other users. Alliances give a sense of protection from enemies. To further emphasize the importance of alliances, we allow allies to chat between each other in a group chat.
