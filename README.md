Description

Rulers of the Kingdom is a medieval strategy war game. Users are able to gather resources and upgrade city structures. Updating their city allows them to better defend it against opponents as well as collect an increased number of resources from their structures such as gold mines. Users can also buy troops, limited by the number of farms. Users can attack other users of the same level; if a user successfully attack another user he will steal some of his resources. In a battle both the attacker and the defender will loose a certain amount of troops, depending on the outcome of the battle. In order to upgrade city structures and buy troops users are required to pay a certain amount of gold and/or specific resources like lumber and stones. Users can also create or join alliances with other users in order to achieve also the best scores as alliance. Users cannot attack allied members. To further emphasize the importance of alliances, we allow allies to chat between each other and give out orders in a group chat.
